# Lesson 1.1: Robotics Fundamentals

## Learning Objectives

After completing this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define what constitutes a robot
- Identify the main components of robotic systems
- Distinguish between different types of robots
- Understand basic robot classifications
- Recognize applications of robotics in various fields

## Introduction

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that combines mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, and other disciplines to design, construct, operate, and apply robots. In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts that form the basis of robotics.

## What is a Robot?

A robot is a programmable machine that can perform tasks automatically or with minimal human intervention. Key characteristics of robots include:

- **Sensing**: Ability to perceive their environment through sensors
- **Processing**: Ability to interpret sensor data and make decisions
- **Acting**: Ability to physically interact with their environment through actuators
- **Autonomy**: Ability to operate with varying degrees of independence

## Main Components of Robotic Systems

### 1. Mechanical Structure
The physical body of the robot, including:
- Chassis/frame
- Joints and links
- End effectors (grippers, tools)

### 2. Sensors
Devices that allow robots to perceive their environment:
- Vision systems (cameras)
- Range finders (LIDAR, ultrasonic)
- Tactile sensors
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs)

### 3. Actuators
Components that enable robot movement:
- Electric motors
- Hydraulic systems
- Pneumatic systems
- Servo motors

### 4. Controller
The "brain" of the robot that processes information and controls actions:
- Microcontrollers
- Single-board computers
- Industrial PLCs

### 5. Power System
Provides energy to operate the robot:
- Batteries
- Power supplies
- Fuel cells

## Types of Robots

### By Mobility
- **Stationary Robots**: Fixed in location (industrial arms)
- **Mobile Robots**: Can move through environment (wheeled, legged, aerial)
- **Mobile Manipulators**: Combine mobility with manipulation capabilities

### By Application
- **Industrial Robots**: Manufacturing and assembly
- **Service Robots**: Domestic and professional services
- **Medical Robots**: Surgical and rehabilitation applications
- **Military Robots**: Defense and reconnaissance
- **Entertainment Robots**: Toys and interactive systems

## Robot Classifications

### By Control Method
- **Autonomous**: Operate independently
- **Teleoperated**: Controlled remotely by humans
- **Semiautonomous**: Combination of autonomous and manual control

### By Degree of Autonomy
- **Level 0**: No automation
- **Level 1**: Driver assistance
- **Level 2**: Partial automation
- **Level 3**: Conditional automation
- **Level 4**: High automation
- **Level 5**: Full automation

## Applications of Robotics

### Industrial Applications
- Assembly and manufacturing
- Material handling and logistics
- Quality inspection and testing
- Painting and welding

### Service Applications
- Domestic robots (vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers)
- Healthcare assistance
- Customer service robots
- Educational robots

### Specialized Applications
- Space exploration
- Underwater operations
- Hazardous environment operations
- Search and rescue

## Key Takeaways

1. Robots are programmable machines with sensing, processing, and acting capabilities
2. All robots share common components: mechanical structure, sensors, actuators, controller, and power
3. Robots can be classified by mobility, application, control method, and autonomy level
4. Robotics applications span multiple industries and continue to expand

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll explore ROS 2 basics and how to set up your first robotic system. This foundational knowledge will prepare you for hands-on robotics development.

## Exercises

1. Research and identify 3 different types of robots, categorizing them by mobility and application
2. List the main components you would expect to find in a mobile robot
3. Identify one application where robotics provides advantages over traditional methods
