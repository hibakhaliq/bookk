# Chapter 2: Purpose and Focus

## Purpose

The purpose of this chapter is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware framework that enables communication between different components of a robotic system. Students will learn to create ROS 2 packages, implement communication patterns, and build distributed robotic applications.

## Focus Areas

1. **ROS 2 Architecture**: Understanding the DDS-based communication layer and middleware architecture
2. **Package Management**: Creating, building, and managing ROS 2 packages
3. **Communication Patterns**: Implementing publisher-subscriber, service-client, and action-based communication
4. **Launch Systems**: Using launch files to manage complex robot systems
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Understanding node lifecycle and management in ROS 2

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, students will:
- Understand the architecture and components of ROS 2
- Create and build ROS 2 packages using ament build systems
- Implement publisher-subscriber communication patterns
- Develop service-based request-response interactions
- Use launch files to coordinate multiple nodes
- Understand the differences between ROS 1 and ROS 2

## Prerequisites

Students should have:
- Basic programming knowledge in Python or C++
- Understanding of robotics concepts from Chapter 1
- Basic Linux command line skills
- Familiarity with version control systems (helpful but not required)

## Technical Depth Level

**Intermediate** - This chapter builds upon the foundational concepts from Chapter 1 and introduces more complex programming and system design concepts. Students should be comfortable with basic programming constructs and system architecture principles.
